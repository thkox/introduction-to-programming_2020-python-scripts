## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Square Array Manipulation
**Description:**  
Write a Python code that takes the dimension of a square and creates the corresponding array using lists. The code then finds the total number of positions and randomly fills half of them with ones. The goal is to count how many groups of four ones there are horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The program repeats 100 times (for the same dimension) and returns the average number of groups.

### Exercise 3: KINO Number Statistics Using OPAP API
**Description:**  
Use the OPAP API (https://www.opap.gr/web-services) from Python to display the statistics of the numbers that win the first drawing of the day for KINO for the current month.

### Exercise 9: ASCII Odd Number Conversion and Statistics
**Description:**  
Write a Python code that takes an ASCII text file as input and converts each character to the corresponding ASCII number, keeping only the odd numbers. Display the occurrence statistics of each letter using “bars” with the character \*, where each \* corresponds to 1%.

### Exercise 12: ASCII Mirror Characters
**Description:**  
Write a Python code that takes an ASCII text file as input and converts each character to its "mirror" ASCII character. Mirror characters are those whose sum is 255. Display the mirrored text to the user in reverse character order.
